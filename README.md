# Covid19_Excel_Dashbaord
COVID-19 Dashboard that can be updated daily by simply clicking on the "Refresh All" button on the Microsoft Excel Data tab.

I made use of Excel's web query to extract data from [covid19.ncdc.gov.ng](covid19.ncdc.gov.ng) and with the combination of some functions like OFFSET, INDEX, MATCH, DATE, DATEVALUE, MID, RIGHT, LEFT, FIND, TEXT, LARGE, ROW etc I was able to develop this simple Dashboard.

I added a little Data Validation using Drop Down List (with the help of Named Range) to enable users toggle between TOTAL and State by State Category.

As at the last COVID-19 update (yesterday, 12th of August, 2020), Lagos appears in the list of Top 5 States in the Number of Confirmed Cases, Deaths, Discharged, and Active Cases. FCT has the highest number of Active Cases, while Lagos has the highest number of Cases, Deaths, as well as Number of Discharged people.

While Edo Governorship election is in a Month's time, it is heart-rending to note that Edo has the 4th highest number of Confirmed Cases and the second-highest number of Deaths, even though it has the second-highest number of Discharged people.
